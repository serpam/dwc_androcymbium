See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<li><p>Los valores de abundancia se expresaran en la variable
<code>measurementValue</code></p></li>
<li><p>Formateamos el campo fecha para que aparezca en formato
<code>YYYYMMDD</code> y generamos una variable llamada
<code>measurementDeterminedDate</code></p></li>
<li><p>Para generar los eventos consideraremos que cada cuadrado de 50 x
50 son subreplicas, puesto que no podemos asegurar que lo etiquetado en
la base de datos como cuadrante Este se haya mantenido siempre,
simplemente para no perder información (agregación), vamos a considerar
siempre 4 subreplicas (que no tienen porque mantenerse en el tiempo, es
decir, la subreplica Este del plot A16 no siempre tiene porque ser la
misma -no tenemos la certeza-). Teniendo eso en cuenta, generamos un
acrónimo para cada cuadrante: Norte será <code>QN</code>; Sur será
<code>QS</code>, Este será <code>QE</code> y oeste será <code>QW</code>.
De este modo además homogeneizamos los datos con respecto a los
transectos de diversidad (Transectos 1 y 2: <code>T1</code> y
<code>T2</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Generamos el eventID y añadimos además las palabras
<code>SERPAM</code> y <code>AMOLADERAS</code> para distinguir la
colección de bases de datos y la base de datos. Esto tenemos que
consultarlo con GBIF.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>El measurmenteID será del siguiente modo <code>EVENTID_VV</code>,
siendo <code>EVENTID</code> el eventID y <code>VV</code> la variable
medida. En el caso de abundancia y según el diccionario de variables
tenemos que la abundancia se llama <code>A01</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Generamos los siguientes campos para la variable abundancia (ver
diccionario de variables)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>measurementType</code>: “abundance”</li>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
